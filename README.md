# Reminders to Myself - Chrome Extension

Get a Reminder to Yourself whenever you open a new tab in Google Chrome.

To install the extension - 

1. Download the zip and then unzip in your laptop/PC
2. Go to Google Chrome and type chrome://extensions in the URL bar
3. Turn on the Developer Mode from the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder.
5. Done. Now every time you open a new tab, you will get a Reminder to Yourself.

If I get enough support, I'll publish it on the Chrome Web Store. :)
